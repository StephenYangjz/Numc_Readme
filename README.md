# Numc Python Package

Welcome to Numc, a library for the Python programming language, adding support for very large and multi-dimensional matrix operations. The Numc package also provides an easy, convenient, and efficient way for these operations. This repository is developed in UC Berkeley CS61C as a class project by Rory Na and Stephen Yang.

## Sample commands:

#### CREATE NEW MATRIX:
Follow the following steps in order to create a matrix in the python terminal.
Import the Numc package: import Numc as nc

To create a new matrix, use the following syntax:
nc.Matrix([[a, b, c], â€¦ ]) where a, b, and c are integers or double-precision float numbers in the C language. You may create the matrix in any reasonable dimensions, by concatenating the numbers(a, b, c) or the rows [a, b, c]. You need to use commas to separate the values.
nc.Matrix(m, n) where m and n are the rows and the columns of the matrix. The matrix will be filled with all zeros. 
nc.Matrix(m, n, val) where m and n are the rows and the columns of the matrix and val is the value that the matrix will be filled with.

Example usage: 
~~~ 
a = nc.Matrix([[1, -2, 3.0], [-4, -5, 6], [7.0, 8, -9]])
The variable a is now assigned to a representation of a 3x3 matrix with elements [1, -2, 3.0] in the first row, [-4, -5, 6] in the second row, and [7.0, 8, -9] in the third row.
b = nc.Matrix(3, 3)
The variable b is now assigned to a representation of a 3x3 matrix with elements [0, 0, 0] in the first row, [0, 0, 0] in the second row, and [0, 0, 0] in the third row.
c = nc.Matrix(3, 3, 2)
The variable c is now assigned to a representation of a 3x3 matrix with elements [2, 2, 2] in the first row, [2, 2, 2] in the second row, and [2, 2, 2] in the third row.

## Performances:
The plugin supports SIMD, OpenMP, cache blocking and loop unrolling rendering you unprecedentedly fast performance improvements in large operations, such as taking a large square or multiplying large matrices.
